   - **Advantages**: Strong image-text understanding, pre-trained on diverse data
   - **Size**: ~400MB (B/32), ~1.7GB (L/14)
   - **Custom fine-tuning** on fashion-specific datasets

2. **EfficientNet + Custom Heads**
   - **Base**: EfficientNet-B0 to B3
   - **Advantages**: Excellent efficiency-accuracy trade-off
   - **Size**: 20MB (B0) to 47MB (B3)

3. **MobileViT or MobileNetV3**
   - **Advantages**: Extremely lightweight, mobile-optimized
   - **Size**: 5-25MB
   - **Trade-off**: Lower accuracy for complex tasks

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Multi-Task Learning Architecture
```
Input Image → Shared Feature Extractor → Task-Specific Heads:
├── Background Removal Head → Dominant Color Extraction
├── Person Detection Head → Gender Classification
├── Image Captioning Head → Description Generation
├── Fashion Segmentation Head → Outfit Analysis
└── Skin Tone Analysis Head → Color Recommendation
```

### Key Technical Components

#### 1. **Image Preprocessing Pipeline**

        "length": "mini|midi|maxi|knee-length|ankle" // for bottoms/dresses
      },
      "color_analysis": {
        "primary_colors": ["#hex_codes"],
        "secondary_colors": ["#hex_codes"],
        "color_harmony": "monochromatic|complementary|analogous|triadic"
      },
      "style_context": {
        "occasion": "casual|formal|party|business|athletic|lounge",
        "season": "spring|summer|fall|winter|all-season",
        "style_genre": "classic|trendy|bohemian|minimalist|vintage"
      },
      "bounding_box": [x1, y1, x2, y2],
      "confidence_score": 0.0-1.0,
      "fabric_prediction": "cotton|denim|silk|wool|polyester|blend"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 3. **Color Theory Integration**
- **Skin tone analysis**: Undertone detection (warm/cool/neutral)
- **Color wheel mapping**: HSV color space analysis
- **Harmony algorithms**: 
  - Complementary: 180° hue difference
  - Analogous: ±30° hue range
  - Triadic: 120° intervals
  - Monochromatic: Same hue, varied saturation/brightness

#### 4. **Advanced Features**
- **Occasion prediction**: Multi-label classification with contextual reasoning
- **Style transfer suggestions**: Based on detected preferences
- **Seasonal appropriateness**: Climate and trend analysis
- **Body type consideration**: Silhouette analysis for fit recommendations
